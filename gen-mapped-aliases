# this is essential, Postfix will run any scripts listed in the alias
# file using the UID/GID of the file's owner
# if Mailman bounces messages with something like
#   Group mismatch error.  Mailman expected the mail wrapper
#   script to be executed as group "daemon", but the system's mail server
#   executed the mail script as group "nogroup".
# then you need to check who owns this file:
chgrp "${MM_MAIL_GID}" ${ALIASES_FILE}.db

# this is also essential, if Postfix sees the file with the wrong owner
# it will refuse to run the scripts.  reload/restart causes Postfix to
# re-discover the permissions on the files:
service postfix reload
